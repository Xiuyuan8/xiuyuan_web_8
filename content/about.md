Hello, everyone. This is Xiuyuan's personal website. I am a PhD candidate of Water Resources Engineering. My passion is to solve natural hazard and natural resources issues in real world by data science. My current research topic is to decode flood mechanisms and predict flooding under climate change by machine learning model.
