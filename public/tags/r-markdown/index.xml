      <description>Background Greg is a PhD student in Chemical Engineering with a focus on intrinsically disordered proteins, and is a good friend of mine. Both of us are music lovers, although he likes heavy metal, while I prefer classical and romantic. But it seems that we have the same taste for Christian music.
